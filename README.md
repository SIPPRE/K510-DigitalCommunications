# K510-Digital Communications Course Supplementary Material
The Repository of the Digital Communications Undergraduate Course of the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Peloponnese.

The code is included in the course textbook: **"Modern Digital and Analog Communication Systems"** 4th and 5th edition by B.P. Lathi, and Zhi Ding. Most of the code is written in MATLAB, some minor changes have also been made to make the code feasible to run in Octave (some functions had to be written as they were missing  in the octave / communications package).
In addition, code is also included in Python, using two main Digital Communications packages in python:
* [Komm package] https://github.com/rwnobrega/komm  and
* [CommPy package] https://github.com/veeresht/CommPy
